Originally hailing from Staten Island, New York - I know a thing or two about being obnoxious in Japanese cars.

## Testimonials

### Kevin Cash

I recently had the pleasure of working with Joe T. at JPC Trade Co., who made what should have been an overly complex process surprisingly easy. Joe’s expertise and patience were evident as he guided me through the onboarding process for JPC’s auction platform. He explained and translated the auction sheets in detail, ensuring I understood every aspect. Without his help, interpreting these sheets would have been nearly impossible.

Joe took the time to answer all my questions, ensuring I grasped each step of this multifaceted, and often convoluted, journey. He also managed the coordination with customs brokers and shippers, ensuring everything was handled smoothly and without stress. His proactive approach and commitment to customer satisfaction made all the difference.

I find it hard to imagine other JDM sales consultants put in as much energy and care as Joe from JPC. I’d be foolish to work with anyone else.

### Jake n Ryan's Imports

Joe was outstanding! I had been looking up and down for a place to give my business to, you go through the run around of sketchy places you don't feel like you can fully trust, but with Joseph at JPC it was different.

As a new importer myself and all the questions I had, Joe was able to confidently answer every single question. I was so scared to import and had my fair share of anxieties, but when Joe had a phone call with me for probably over an hour about how this whole operation works I knew I had to pick him to do business with. Even while operating with an American on different time zones he was FAST to respond, attentive, and extremely knowledgeable. It felt good to know my choice in Kei Truck was a secure and good investment with the way he was able to provide me every single piece of information, get the car inspected, and successfully place our bid to lock it in.

We won the truck and Joe had everything buttoned top to bottom on how things were going to go, when they were going to happen, and how to follow all the steps to make sure we received the truck in the condition we purchased it in. An absolute stand up gentleman and his professionalism will never go unnoticed with any client he takes care of, no doubt! Thank you to JPC and especially Joe for making this process an absolute cake walk!

My experience with JPCTrade and specifically Joe was fantastic. I was brand new to import/export and he was able to guide and teach me through the process making it much more simple and approachable. I would 100% recommend Joe and JPCTrade to a friend or colleague
