# Why I Decided to Code My Own JLPT N2 Website

![coding-n2](/assets/images/cacto-code.png)

Learning Japanese is already a challenge, but studying for the **JLPT N2** adds a whole new level of intensity. As an intermediate learner aiming to pass the N2, I often found myself frustrated with the scattered nature of existing resources. That’s why I decided to code my own website dedicated entirely to JLPT N2 preparation.

---

## 1. Existing resources felt cluttered

Many Japanese learning platforms try to cover every level from N5 to N1, which is great in theory but often leads to cluttered interfaces, irrelevant example sentences, or a lack of focus on the specific grammar and vocabulary that actually appear in N2. I wanted a place laser-focused on N2, with no distractions, ads, or endless notifications to upgrade to premium.

---

## 2. I wanted full control over my study flow

Using other apps, I was constantly thinking, “I wish they included this conjugation table,” or “Why don’t they provide multiple example sentences for each grammar point?” By coding my own site, I could structure each page exactly how I learn best: direct explanations, concise usage notes, and examples covering casual, formal, academic, spoken, and anime/manga contexts.

---

## 3. Coding itself is a skill worth practicing

As a self-taught developer, I wanted a meaningful project to apply my frontend skills and deepen my understanding of frameworks like Astro and Next.js. Building N2 Gokaku gave me hands-on practice with content structuring, SEO optimization, database integration, and interactive features – all while directly benefiting my Japanese studies.

---

## 4. A personal tool that grows with me

Unlike static textbooks, my site can grow with my needs. If I want to add listening practice sections later, integrate Notion study templates, or embed AI-powered flashcard generators, I can do so without waiting for an external platform update.

---

## 5. Sharing with others keeps me accountable

By publishing my grammar notes and vocabulary pages publicly, I stay motivated to write high-quality explanations that others can benefit from. Teaching, after all, is one of the best ways to master a topic – and building N2 Gokaku has become an extension of my study routine.

---

## ✅ Final Thoughts

At its core, coding my own JLPT N2 website is about efficiency, customization, and accountability. I wanted a **no-nonsense, clean, and focused platform** tailored to what intermediate learners truly need to pass the N2 and use Japanese confidently in work and life. If you’re considering building your own tools, I highly recommend it – you’ll learn more than just vocabulary along the way.
